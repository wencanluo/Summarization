1 	1) Group activity of analyzing bicycle's parts [12] ;2) Materials processing [6];3) The main topic of this course [4] 	1) Grading process [14];2) Homework assignments [5];3) Differences between types of bonding 	1) Working in a small group [13];2) Picures and visuals [3];3) Teaching to others [2] 	[1]  the most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the grading scale because i have never heard of a normalized grading scale, and i like the fairness of it; [2]  i thought it was interesting that only 3 families of materials were mentioned. do all materials fit into those categories? or are there others that not studied in this class?; [3]  i already  had this lecture in mse 100 but i would say that the bonding test was the most interesting; 	[1]  nothing presented was confusing, material that was given on the pre-test was confusing (need to learn those topics); [2]  the grading is kind of confusing but as the class progresses i am sure it will be more clear. by the sounds of it, the grading has been chosen based on a method that will ensure students equal fairness and an opportunity to succeed; [3]  i think that even though grade normalizing was interesting, i think it was somewhat confusing and needs a little more explaining; 	[1]  i learned about different materials and i learned that i'm going to have to study hard for this class; [2]  i learned that taking risks in learning help me learn more; [3]  i learned that i learn best by seeing things presented on the power point;
2 	1) Differents bonds and their effect on materials properties;2) Diamond Tthermal conduction;3) Motorcycle's parts activitiy 	1) Differences between types of bonding [8];2) Electrical properties [8];3) Print out was hard to read [8];4) Distinguishing the type of bonding based on the name of the material [5] 	1) Activities and group working [10];2) Pictures, diagram and examples [8] 	[1]  i found all the different bonds and their characteristic very interesting and in the activity i thought it was interesting to figure out what a motorcycle was made of; [2]  i found it interesting to apply chemical bonding to parts of a motorcycle. in chemistry, we never applied bonding to materials like a car seat or windshield; [3]  i found that the higher the electronegativity difference that the type of bonding changes. usually if its higher, the bonding is stronger and is usually ionic. this was fairly interesting for me.; 	[1]  i was a little lost at the beginning of the lecture b/c it had been a while since i've used common chemistry terms (valance, cation, anion ¡K) how do you know when something is covalent + van der wall versus just van der wall; [2]  the muddiest point i would have to say would have been the first activity. at first i wasn't sure what was supposed to be done and i really had no idea how to complete the activity; [3]  the worksheets are hard to read, and i think that there needs to be more explanation when talking about bonding and what type of materials have what type of bonding; 	[1]  i learned that i am a visual learner and concepts are difficult to understand when pictures are small && blurry; [2]  i learned that i need to ask questions about what i don't understand; [3]  i learned that i learn better and stay more focused when we do the in class activities since i can see the application of what we learn put into play right away;

4 	1) Specific structure & their properties [16];2) The real world examples and disasters relation to materials [15] 	1) In class activities (Spectially the first activity) [14];2) Atomic Packing Factor and relation between a&r [9];3) Which structure produce which materials' properties and how unit cell affects the processing [5] 	1) Group activities are great [6];2) Need more explanation before doing activities [4];3) Pictures and visuals [4] 	[1]  you can grow silicon in different crystal structures (100, 111, 110) and this dictate the properties & type of transistor you can build; [2]  i enjoyed learning about the properties of different structures of different materials; [3]  it was interesting to bring in history ( napoleon) to class. its easier to see a connection when i can see real life examples.; 	[1]  unit cell transformation pictures in 1st activity, 2nd activity (characteristics) # of atomic radii along touch directions with in unice cell; [2]  unit cells atomic factor + length fd + length bd; [3]  the atomic packing factor idea was very confusing and needed more explanation; 	[1]  i feel like the slideshows contain a lot of information that i will need to review them multiple times to learn the information; [2]  because we had a different professor than normal, i learned that i can only learn by some professors. some are harder to learn from than others. *also, i'm visual person.; [3]  i learned that i don¡¦t learn very well when the lecture begings to talk and teach at a very fast pace;
5 	1) Unit cell direction drawing and indexing [14];2) Real world examples [4];3) Importance of cell direction on materials properties 	1) Indexing (most confusing was: choosing the nw origin, then directions within unit cell and then fractions for indecies) [11];2) Differences between unit cells  (BCC, FCC, etc), unit cell calculations related to r & a, unit cell volume [5];3) APF and determining close packing [9] 	1) Group activities help specially because of having the 4 steps instruction [13];2) Visuals help (pictures and graphs) [6];3) Reviewing last week topic helps [2] 	[1]  unit cell directions, i like the method to draw the direction; [2]  i found the activities interesting because i feel i understand the concept of the structure of unit cells; [3]  i thought that the unit cell directions was the most interesting of all those topics discussed; 	[1]  there were a few points (such as unit cell direction, how they are indexed) that i wasn't sure on. it got better as we went over it in the activity though; [2]  i think that trying to find the directions is confusing because i do not understand how to move the origin then find the direction; [3]  why don't (like the coordinates of the origin) have round brackets around them? i understand that the vector needs square brackets but i thought points should be written (0,0,0); 	[1]  i metacogged about my procedural knowledge and gained definitional knowledge of the term "definitional knowledge"; [2]  i learned that i learn well by doing the in class activities with my table as a group; [3]  i learned that i really hate spending about 60% at class each day relearning what we already know what was told to us 2 days prior, or what was told to us twice or thrice already in the same class;
6 	1) Planes, the technique for drawing them, indexing them and being understandable [24];2) Structure of salt [2] 	1) Planar density calulation [13];2) Packing density [10];3) Drawing the planes [6];4) Family unit and type of brackets [4] 	1) Group activities [17];2) Visualizing [4];3) Per & Post test helps [2];4) Negative : Not seeing what is written on the white board [2] 	[1]  i liked learning about and drawing the planes, its really fun and i found it interesting; [2]  really liked the concept of planes and their directional relationship to the packing directions; [3]  it was interesting to learn about the specified planes because i understood it; 	[1]  drawing the intersection of atoms with the unit cell planes; [2]  inverting plane indices, visualizing planes through atoms, areas of atoms and planes; [3]  drawing the planes and figuring out how the planes touch is very confusing and hard to conceptualize; 	[1]  i like the drawing activities, i find them very helpful when it comes to learning about the materials; [2]  i learned that i learn very well by doing in class activities; [3]  i have a hard time visualizing things when there isn't a diagram, because i get confused about directions;
7 	1) Positive effect of defect, dislocastion and impurities on materials' properties [16];2) Solid solubility's rules [9];3) The examples of defect in the nature, Cactus and diamonds [7] 	1) Dislocations: how do they affect materials properties, how are they foremd [10];2) Last activity ( Effect of defects on materials properties) [8];3) Grain boundaries [6];4) Different type of defects [5] 	1) Group activities [9];2) Pre-studying [4];3) Listening to teacher [3] 	[1]  i thought learning about the defects was interesting because i never knew they could actually be a good thing; [2]  i found the solubility graphs of metals interesting how it depends mainly on atomic radius to see if two metals are soluble; [3]  i found out how dislocations  & defects affect material properties; 	[1]  the phase diagrams demonstrating solubility were a little confusing because i have only seen phase diagrams with one substance in the past; [2]  the most confusing point for me was the activity on effects of defects on materials properties; [3]  still confused on when to use [ ] and ( ) families of planestypes of directions in a planeedge/ screw dislocations grain boundaries; 	[1]  i learned that group review activities only serve to waste time. by moving at ? a slow rate, the class in doing a disservice to those who want to learn and are actually willing to put in their own effort to ensure leering  should the class move at a too rapid p?. as it is, we learn maybe 1/3 of what we could in the valuable class time we are paying for and spend the other 2/3 of the time relearning, reviewing and relearning yet again what we were just taught!; [2]  i assume that i'll remember things therefore i don't write it down. now, i realize i'm not as prepared for the test as i thought i'd be; [3]  in the beginning of the semester, when i had a printed copy of the notes before the next lecture and i reviewed them before the lecture, i understood the material much better;
8 	1) Learning about misconception: Stress or deformation can strengthen materials [7];2) Stress-Strain curve [6];3) Paper clips hands on activity [5];4) Effect of defects on LED example [3] 	1) How to calculate % el and % RA, what's Ao in % RA calculation [8];2) Stress-strain graph calculations [6];3) Terminology: what's stress?! What are toughness, stiffness & Fraction total strain [3] 	1) Group activities [10];2) Hands-on activities [6];3) 5th HW problems (preparing for next class) help[3] 	[1]  i found the tensile strength and how the paper clip become harder to bend very interesting; [2]  the most interesting thing i found was how stress-strain affect the atoms of the materials; [3]  i find it very interesting that deformation makes a material harder. to me, i originally thought that the more deformation, material has, the weaker it would be; 	[1]  very little was confusing but if i must say, the most confusing thing was the graph on the tensile test concept map (need more explanation of what everything means); [2]  i thought the stress-strain curves are confusing because i am still not sure how to calculate some of the stress; [3]  the stress vs. strain graph is still a little confusing; 	[1]  i think the stress-strain curves are interesting, i just wish they were explained a little more; [2]  i learn better when i don't get only 5 hours of sleep; [3]  i learned that i learn very well by doing in-class activities and work together as a table;
9 	1) Real examples of failures and why they happened (mostly airplane crash was mentioned) [9];2) Different types of failures [5];3) Brittle vs Ductil fractions [5];4) Types of fatigue behaivior (Fatigue limit) [5];5) Stell vs cast iron (brooklyn bridge) [4];6) Tensile test ;7) Influence of Temperature on impac Energy [1];8) Rlationship between  fractures/ cracks and the crack length/ crack radius 	1) Identifying the graphs for different types of failures, reading the graphs and if they have any specific calculation [9];2) Griffith Crack Formula and concept [5];3) Failure types [3];4) Brittle vs Ductile Fracture (also pictures on slide no. 4) [2];5) Microstuctures of failures [2];6) Influence of T on Impact Energy [2];7) Fracture Toughness Testing [1];8) High Tepm.

11 	1) Different strengthening mechanism for single phase metals and their application (cold work: 3, solid solution hardening: 1, general: 7) [11];2) Different process of fabrication of metals (I-beams: 3, general: 3) [6];3) Recrystallization & grain boundary  changes[5];4) Misconception: even adding a weaker metal to a stronger metal will make the alloy stronger [2];5) 3-D edge and screw dislocation models [2];6) Cyclotron and uranium info [2];7) The difference between Hot & Cold working a metal & its effects on the crystal structure of a metal [1];8) how to affect materials' strength & ductility [1];9) Dislocations [1] 	1)How does dislocation affect Thermal & Electrical conductivity [8];2) What is Cold Working, % Cw calculation, how to read its graphs,  why ductility reduces by CW, CW vs hot work, CW vs Grain size reduction [8];3) Grain Size Reduction understanding, hall-Petch equation, Anealing relation to dislocation and grain size,  recrystallization, properties of metals after grain growth [7];4) First activity, difference between deformation processing (Rolling, drawing, extrusion, etc) [6];5) Final activity (Effect of CW, Annealing, grain size on Mechanical & other prop.)  [2];6) Why the strengthening occurs based on cold working or hot working [1];7) Why does lead allow for hot working at such a low temp? [1];8) Different strengthen mechanism [1] 	1) Group discussion helps a lot (including: explaining to others, learning from classmates or TAs) [6];2) Activities are very helpful (Including: activities with the graphs, doing it first by myself then within a group) [5];3) Visually [2];4) Graphs and pictures help if: they are explained, they are well labled [2];5) Seeing more applications and real life examples [2];6) HW preview problem and redoing it at the class [2];7) Phoenix to Tucson example helped [1];8) New Concepts;9) Don't like the preview problem of the HW 	[1]  i found the models passed around class to be quite interesting. it was cool to see a 3-d model of what we are learning about; [2]  i thought learning about the different applications and  processes of metals was interesting; [3]  i really was interested in how different product (i- beams, bike gears, etc.) are made using different strengthening mechanism; 	[1]  which process strengthens materials more effectively? cold working or grain size?; [2]  nothing was really muddy, however, i did have a side thought about grains and recrystallization. do galvanized metal and grain relate somehow? the shine galvanized steel reminds me of the grain images; [3]  how the electrical + thermal conductivity increases or decreases based on the dislocation density was a bit unclear; 	[1]  i learn by hand on materials and being told things in bullet points about hands on materials.(for example: when you passed around the screw dislocation model you told us "as it goes in a spiral motion around the model, the go down a  level known as the burgers vector"); [2]  the dislocation crystal models are very cool and i saw that it helped people understand it better; [3]  i found i learn better when arguing in groups;
