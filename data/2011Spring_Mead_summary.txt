1 	Group activity of analyzing bicycle's parts;Materials processing;The main topic of this course 	i thought it was interesting that only 3 families of materials were mentioned. do all materials fit into those categories? or are there others that not studied in this class?;i was interested in learning what i will be learning about this semester;the most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the grading scale because i have never heard of a normalized grading scale, and i like the fairness of it 	Grading process;Homework assignments;Differences between types of bonding 	the grading is kind of confusing but as the class progresses i am sure it will be more clear. by the sounds of it, the grading has been chosen based on a method that will ensure students equal fairness and an opportunity to succeed;i thought that straight into the activity was confusing because i know close to nothing about materials;i think that even though grade normalizing was interesting, i think it was somewhat confusing and needs a little more explaining 	Working in a small group;Picures and visuals;Teaching to others 	i like group discussions & learning, but not group assignments;i learned about different materials and i learned that i'm going to have to study hard for this class;i learned that i learn best by seeing things presented on the power point
2 	Differents bonds and their effect on materials properties;Diamond Tthermal conduction;Motorcycle's parts activitiy 	i found that the higher the electronegativity difference that the type of bonding changes. usually if its higher, the bonding is stronger and is usually ionic. this was fairly interesting for me.;i found all the different bonds and their characteristic very interesting and in the activity i thought it was interesting to figure out what a motorcycle was made of;i found it interesting to apply chemical bonding to parts of a motorcycle. in chemistry, we never applied bonding to materials like a car seat or windshield 	Differences between types of bonding;Electrical properties;Print out was hard to read;Distinguishing the type of bonding based on the name of the material 	i didn't understand the thermal properties very well, especially because i couldn't read the labels on the graphs clearly. thermal expansion + elastic modulus were totally new concepts for me;the worksheets are hard to read, and i think that there needs to be more explanation when talking about bonding and what type of materials have what type of bonding;the muddiest point i would have to say would have been the first activity. at first i wasn't sure what was supposed to be done and i really had no idea how to complete the activity 	Activities and group working;Pictures, diagram and examples 	i think if work sheets required me to explain, i would think more critically;i learned that i learn better and stay more focused when we do the in class activities since i can see the application of what we learn put into play right away;i learned that i need to ask questions about what i don't understand
3 	How bond strength is related to melting point;Relative strenghts of different bond types;Elastic modulus;How plastic bags are made by polymer fil blowing 	bond energy diagram and its relationship to coeff of thermal expansion;i like learning about the microscopic explanation for the microscopic properties, especially, i liked learning about bond strengths;how bond strength is related to melting point and that melting point is on the periodic table 	Graphs of attraction/ repulsive & atomic separation;Properties and equations with bond strength;Coefficient of thermal expansion;Activity part III 	4: axes on coefficient of thermal expansion graph5:hooke's law-you need a laser pointer,15% of the class can't see what you are pointing at;we jumped right into several slides with complicated graphs and undefined variables. i couldn't understand the trends;i think graphs and equations are hard to understand because i'm unfamiliar with the terms and equations 	Activities;Reading ahead;Negative: Bad Class environment (like turning to see the board, not being able to read the white board, noises from other classes, etcâ€¦);Graphs are helpful if they come along side text 	revision of topics i learned in another class helps a lot with these concepts;i figured out that i learn the best when we do the in-class activities and then work out the problems by table. it helps in case you got a wrong answer and want the correct answer and get an explanation of why it was wrong.;i learned, or rather remembered, that i find group activities to not be helpful at all. lectures are interesting & stimulating when they're on new material, but reworking the same in activities does not help me in the slightest. i would prefer to learn more concepts with my time than spend 15 min on a 5 min "activity". sorry i'm just being honest.
