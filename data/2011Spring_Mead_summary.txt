1 	Group activity of analyzing bicycle's parts;Materials processing;The main topic of this course 	I thought it was interesting that only 3 families of materials were mentioned. Do all materials fit into those categories? Or are there others that not studied in this class?;I wasn't aware of what the class was about clearly the introduction during this first class fixed this information which was previously unknown;The most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the grading scale because I have never heard of a normalized grading scale, and I like the fairness of it 	Grading process;Homework assignments;Differences between types of bonding 	The grading is kind of confusing but as the class progresses I am sure it will be more clear. By the sounds of it, the grading has been chosen based on a method that will ensure students equal fairness and an opportunity to succeed;I think that even though grade normalizing was interesting, I think it was somewhat confusing and needs a little more explaining;Nothing presented was confusing, material that was given on the pre-test was confusing (Need to learn those topics) 	Working in a small group;Picures and visuals;Teaching to others 	I like group discussions & learning, but not group assignments;I learned about different materials and I learned that I'm going to have to study hard for this class;I learned that I learn best by seeing things presented on the power point
2 	Differents bonds and their effect on materials properties;Diamond Tthermal conduction;Motorcycle's parts activitiy 	I found that the higher the electronegativity difference that the type of bonding changes. Usually if its higher, the bonding is stronger and is usually ionic. This was fairly interesting for me.;I found all the different bonds and their characteristic very interesting and in the activity I thought it was interesting to figure out what a motorcycle was made of;I found it interesting to apply chemical bonding to parts of a motorcycle. In chemistry, we never applied bonding to materials like a car seat or windshield 	Differences between types of bonding;Electrical properties;Print out was hard to read;Distinguishing the type of bonding based on the name of the material 	I didn't understand the thermal properties very well, especially because I couldn't read the labels on the graphs clearly. Thermal expansion + elastic modulus were totally new concepts for me;The worksheets are hard to read, and I think that there needs to be more explanation when talking about bonding and what type of materials have what type of bonding;I was a little lost at the beginning of the lecture b/c it had been a while since I've used common chemistry terms (valance, cation, anion ¡K) how do you know when something is covalent + van der wall versus just van der wall 	Activities and group working;Pictures, diagram and examples 	I think if work sheets required me to explain, I would think more critically;I learned that I learn better and stay more focused when we do the in class activities since I can see the application of what we learn put into play right away;I learned that I need to ask questions about what I don't understand
3 	How bond strength is related to melting point;Relative strenghts of different bond types;Elastic modulus;How plastic bags are made by polymer fil blowing 	I like learning about the microscopic explanation for the microscopic properties, especially, I liked learning about bond strengths;I thought it was interesting that the type of bond makes such a big difference in the temperature required to process different materials;How bond strength is related to melting point and that melting point is on the periodic table 	Graphs of attraction/ repulsive & atomic separation;Properties and equations with bond strength;Coefficient of thermal expansion;Activity part III 	4: AXES on coefficient of thermal expansion graph5:Hooke's law-You need a laser pointer,15% of the class can't see what you are pointing at;We jumped right into several slides with complicated graphs and undefined variables. I couldn't understand the trends;Most of the lecture was muddy. I tried to follow along but I couldn't grasp the concepts. Plus it's hard to see what's written on the white board when the projector shines on it 	Activities;Reading ahead;Negative: Bad Class environment (like turning to see the board, not being able to read the white board, noises from other classes, etcâ€¦);Graphs are helpful if they come along side text 	Revision of topics I learned in another class helps a lot with these concepts;I figured out that I learn the best when we do the in-class activities and then work out the problems by table. It helps in case you got a wrong answer and want the correct answer and get an explanation of why it was wrong.;I learned, or rather remembered, that I find group activities to not be helpful at all. Lectures are interesting & stimulating when they're on new material, but reworking the same in activities does not help me in the slightest. I would prefer to learn more concepts with my time than spend 15 min on a 5 min "activity". Sorry I'm just being honest.
4 	Specific structure & their properties;The real world examples and disasters relation to materials 	You can grow silicon in different crystal structures (100, 111, 110) and this dictate the properties & type of transistor you can build;It was interesting to bring in history ( Napoleon) to class. Its easier to see a connection when I can see real life examples.;I thought it was interesting that shape metal alloys were used in nuclear submarines to protect the people from ¡K themselves with the water 	In class activities (Spectially the first activity);Atomic Packing Factor and relation between a&r;Which structure produce which materials' properties and how unit cell affects the processing 	The math involved with finding atomic packing factor, and the relationship between a and r;Unit cell transformation pictures in 1st activity, 2nd activity (characteristics) # of atomic radii along touch directions with in unice cell;The atomic packing factor idea was very confusing and needed more explanation 	Group activities are great;Need more explanation before doing activities;Pictures and visuals 	I learn better when I can see what the professor is pointing at;Because we had a different professor than normal, I learned that I can only learn by some professors. Some are harder to learn from than others. *Also, I'm visual person.;I learned that I don¡¦t learn very well when the lecture begings to talk and teach at a very fast pace
5 	Unit cell direction drawing and indexing;Real world examples;Importance of cell direction on materials properties 	Unit cell directions, I like the method to draw the direction;I found the activities interesting because I feel I understand the concept of the structure of unit cells;I thought that the unit cell directions was the most interesting of all those topics discussed 	Indexing (most confusing was: choosing the nw origin, then directions within unit cell and then fractions for indecies);Differences between unit cells  (BCC, FCC, etc), unit cell calculations related to r & a, unit cell volume;APF and determining close packing 	I understood everything but my group had problems with their coordinate systems. Maybe the similarities between this and vectors (unit vectors) could be emphasized;Why don't (like the coordinates of the origin) have round brackets around them? I understand that the vector needs square brackets but I thought points should be written (0,0,0);Unit cell directions- how they indexed- confused on how to find new origin 	Group activities help specially because of having the 4 steps instruction;Visuals help (pictures and graphs);Reviewing last week topic helps 	I metacogged about my procedural knowledge and gained definitional knowledge of the term "definitional knowledge";I learned that I learn well by doing the in class activities with my table as a group;I learned that I really hate spending about 60% at class each day relearning what we already know what was told to us 2 days prior, or what was told to us twice or thrice already in the same class
6 	Planes, the technique for drawing them, indexing them and being understandable;Structure of salt 	Really liked the concept of planes and their directional relationship to the packing directions;It was interesting to learn about the specified planes because I understood it;I liked learning about and drawing the planes, its really fun and I found it interesting 	Planar density calulation;Packing density;Drawing the planes;Family unit and type of brackets 	Why we were talking about packing densities along non-touching planes. Is this where they break?;Determining indices of given planes was confusing and drawing atoms on planes;Drawing the intersection of atoms with the unit cell planes 	Group activities;Visualizing;Per & Post test helps;Negative : Not seeing what is written on the white board 	I learn best when I can see what the proffesor is pointing to;I like the drawing activities, I find them very helpful when it comes to learning about the materials;I learned that I learn very well by doing in class activities
7 	Positive effect of defect, dislocastion and impurities on materials' properties;Solid solubility's rules;The examples of defect in the nature, Cactus and diamonds 	. Defects can make material stronger. Mix of metals melts varied (slush);I thought learning about the defects was interesting because I never knew they could actually be a good thing;I found the solubility graphs of metals interesting how it depends mainly on atomic radius to see if two metals are soluble 	Dislocations: how do they affect materials properties, how are they foremd;Last activity ( Effect of defects on materials properties);Grain boundaries;Different type of defects 	The phase diagrams demonstrating solubility were a little confusing because I have only seen phase diagrams with one substance in the past;Explanation of 0-D (Point), 1-D (line), 2-D (Plane). Is this dealing with crystalline structures and plotting planes?;The most confusing point for me was the activity on effects of defects on materials properties 	Group activities;Pre-studying;Listening to teacher 	Figuring stuff on my own helps me remember information;I read the notes before class & it helped a lot;I assume that I'll remember things therefore I don't write it down. Now, I realize I'm not as prepared for the test as I thought I'd be
8 	Learning about misconception: Stress or deformation can strengthen materials;Stress-Strain curve;Paper clips hands on activity;Effect of defects on LED example 	The stress-strain curve was cool, & work hardening;The most interesting thing I found was how stress-strain affect the atoms of the materials;I find it very interesting that deformation makes a material harder. To me, I originally thought that the more deformation, material has, the weaker it would be 	How to calculate % el and % RA, what's Ao in % RA calculation;Stress-strain graph calculations;Terminology: what's stress?! What are toughness, stiffness & Fraction total strain 	¡E Relating 110 direction to close packed plane of atoms ¡E A for % RA;I thought the stress-strain curves are confusing because I am still not sure how to calculate some of the stress;Very little was confusing but if I must say, the most confusing thing was the graph on the tensile test concept map (Need more explanation of what everything means) 	Group activities;Hands-on activities;5th HW problems (preparing for next class) help 	I think the stress-strain curves are interesting, I just wish they were explained a little more;I learn better when I don't get only 5 hours of sleep;I learned that I learn very well by doing in-class activities and work together as a table
