1 	1) Group activity of analyzing bicycle's parts [12] ;2) Materials processing [6];3) The main topic of this course [4] 	1) Grading process [14];2) Homework assignments [5];3) Differences between types of bonding 	1) Working in a small group [13];2) Picures and visuals [3];3) Teaching to others [2] 	[1]  i thought it was interesting that only 3 families of materials were mentioned. do all materials fit into those categories? or are there others that not studied in this class?; [2]  i was interested in learning what i will be learning about this semester; [3]  the most interesting thing in today's class was learning about the grading scale because i have never heard of a normalized grading scale, and i like the fairness of it; 	[1]  the grading is kind of confusing but as the class progresses i am sure it will be more clear. by the sounds of it, the grading has been chosen based on a method that will ensure students equal fairness and an opportunity to succeed; [2]  i thought that straight into the activity was confusing because i know close to nothing about materials; [3]  i think that even though grade normalizing was interesting, i think it was somewhat confusing and needs a little more explaining; 	[1]  i like group discussions & learning, but not group assignments; [2]  i learned about different materials and i learned that i'm going to have to study hard for this class; [3]  i learned that i learn best by seeing things presented on the power point;
2 	1) Differents bonds and their effect on materials properties;2) Diamond Tthermal conduction;3) Motorcycle's parts activitiy 	1) Differences between types of bonding [8];2) Electrical properties [8];3) Print out was hard to read [8];4) Distinguishing the type of bonding based on the name of the material [5] 	1) Activities and group working [10];2) Pictures, diagram and examples [8] 	[1]  i found that the higher the electronegativity difference that the type of bonding changes. usually if its higher, the bonding is stronger and is usually ionic. this was fairly interesting for me.; [2]  i found all the different bonds and their characteristic very interesting and in the activity i thought it was interesting to figure out what a motorcycle was made of; [3]  i found it interesting to apply chemical bonding to parts of a motorcycle. in chemistry, we never applied bonding to materials like a car seat or windshield; 	[1]  i didn't understand the thermal properties very well, especially because i couldn't read the labels on the graphs clearly. thermal expansion + elastic modulus were totally new concepts for me; [2]  the worksheets are hard to read, and i think that there needs to be more explanation when talking about bonding and what type of materials have what type of bonding; [3]  the muddiest point i would have to say would have been the first activity. at first i wasn't sure what was supposed to be done and i really had no idea how to complete the activity; 	[1]  i think if work sheets required me to explain, i would think more critically; [2]  i learned that i learn better and stay more focused when we do the in class activities since i can see the application of what we learn put into play right away; [3]  i learned that i need to ask questions about what i don't understand;
3 	1) How bond strength is related to melting point [10];2) Relative strenghts of different bond types [8];3) Elastic modulus [5];4) How plastic bags are made by polymer fil blowing [4] 	1) Graphs of attraction/ repulsive & atomic separation [10];2) Properties and equations with bond strength [7];3) Coefficient of thermal expansion ;4) Activity part III [4] 	1) Activities [10];2) Reading ahead [4];3) Negative: Bad Class environment (like turning to see the board, not being able to read the white board, noises from other classes, etcâ€¦) [4];4) Graphs are helpful if they come along side text [3] 	[1]  bond energy diagram and its relationship to coeff of thermal expansion; [2]  i like learning about the microscopic explanation for the microscopic properties, especially, i liked learning about bond strengths; [3]  how bond strength is related to melting point and that melting point is on the periodic table; 	[1]  4: axes on coefficient of thermal expansion graph5:hooke's law-you need a laser pointer,15% of the class can't see what you are pointing at; [2]  we jumped right into several slides with complicated graphs and undefined variables. i couldn't understand the trends; [3]  i think graphs and equations are hard to understand because i'm unfamiliar with the terms and equations; 	[1]  revision of topics i learned in another class helps a lot with these concepts; [2]  i figured out that i learn the best when we do the in-class activities and then work out the problems by table. it helps in case you got a wrong answer and want the correct answer and get an explanation of why it was wrong.; [3]  i learned, or rather remembered, that i find group activities to not be helpful at all. lectures are interesting & stimulating when they're on new material, but reworking the same in activities does not help me in the slightest. i would prefer to learn more concepts with my time than spend 15 min on a 5 min "activity". sorry i'm just being honest.;
4 	1) Specific structure & their properties [16];2) The real world examples and disasters relation to materials [15] 	1) In class activities (Spectially the first activity) [14];2) Atomic Packing Factor and relation between a&r [9];3) Which structure produce which materials' properties and how unit cell affects the processing [5] 	1) Group activities are great [6];2) Need more explanation before doing activities [4];3) Pictures and visuals [4] 	[1]  you can grow silicon in different crystal structures (100, 111, 110) and this dictate the properties & type of transistor you can build; [2]  it was interesting to bring in history ( napoleon) to class. its easier to see a connection when i can see real life examples.; [3]  i thought it was interesting that shape metal alloys were used in nuclear submarines to protect the people from ¡K themselves with the water; 	[1]  the math involved with finding atomic packing factor, and the relationship between a and r; [2]  i thought the unit cell activities were confusing because not everyitem was well explained; [3]  unit cell transformation pictures in 1st activity, 2nd activity (characteristics) # of atomic radii along touch directions with in unice cell; 	[1]  i learn better when i can see what the professor is pointing at; [2]  because we had a different professor than normal, i learned that i can only learn by some professors. some are harder to learn from than others. *also, i'm visual person.; [3]  i learned that i don¡¦t learn very well when the lecture begings to talk and teach at a very fast pace;
5 	1) Unit cell direction drawing and indexing [14];2) Real world examples [4];3) Importance of cell direction on materials properties 	1) Indexing (most confusing was: choosing the nw origin, then directions within unit cell and then fractions for indecies) [11];2) Differences between unit cells  (BCC, FCC, etc), unit cell calculations related to r & a, unit cell volume [5];3) APF and determining close packing [9] 	1) Group activities help specially because of having the 4 steps instruction [13];2) Visuals help (pictures and graphs) [6];3) Reviewing last week topic helps [2] 	[1]  unit cell directions, i like the method to draw the direction; [2]  i found the activities interesting because i feel i understand the concept of the structure of unit cells; [3]  i thought that the unit cell directions was the most interesting of all those topics discussed; 	[1]  i understood everything but my group had problems with their coordinate systems. maybe the similarities between this and vectors (unit vectors) could be emphasized; [2]  why don't (like the coordinates of the origin) have round brackets around them? i understand that the vector needs square brackets but i thought points should be written (0,0,0); [3]  unit cell directions- how they indexed- confused on how to find new origin; 	[1]  i metacogged about my procedural knowledge and gained definitional knowledge of the term "definitional knowledge"; [2]  i learned that i learn well by doing the in class activities with my table as a group; [3]  i learned that i really hate spending about 60% at class each day relearning what we already know what was told to us 2 days prior, or what was told to us twice or thrice already in the same class;
6 	1) Planes, the technique for drawing them, indexing them and being understandable [24];2) Structure of salt [2] 	1) Planar density calulation [13];2) Packing density [10];3) Drawing the planes [6];4) Family unit and type of brackets [4] 	1) Group activities [17];2) Visualizing [4];3) Per & Post test helps [2];4) Negative : Not seeing what is written on the white board [2] 	[1]  really liked the concept of planes and their directional relationship to the packing directions; [2]  it was interesting to learn about the specified planes because i understood it; [3]  i liked learning about and drawing the planes, its really fun and i found it interesting; 	[1]  why we were talking about packing densities along non-touching planes. is this where they break?; [2]  determining indices of given planes was confusing and drawing atoms on planes; [3]  i'm still confused about packing density and learning about the planar density, i'm not sure about how to do the calculations; 	[1]  i learn best when i can see what the proffesor is pointing to; [2]  i like the drawing activities, i find them very helpful when it comes to learning about the materials; [3]  i learned that i learn very well by doing in class activities;

10 	1) Test review [8];2) Solid state difusion [7];3) Failure activity (comet crash, engine fallsâ€¦, world trade center) [7];4) Differentprocesses of difusion (like gear's case hardening) [2];5) All diffusion has activation energy regardless of method [1] 	1) Different types of diffusion related processing (distinguishing them) [5];2) Understanding and applications of Fick's laws formula [5];3) Activation energy's graph and factors affecting it [3];4) Understanding of what diffusion means and how it occur in metals [3];5) Mechanical properties calculation (in test review, problem III, stress-strain curve) [3];6) Test review needs more time [2] 	1) Group activities (drawing diagram/ filling charts) [8];2) Reviewing Muddiest Point in the beginning of the class [4];3) Test review helped [3] 	[1]  the many uses for diffusing/ metal into another with no melting required; [2]  case hardening of gears is interesting. it's cool that by diffusing carbon the gear strength increases; [3]  the interstitial diffusion of materials (atoms) in a metal that has been heated to almost melting point; 	[1]  i don't understand all of the diffusion types and their importance; [2]  do you really read these? how do i know?how much does the woodpecker elongate? include all assumptions; [3]  i found what diffusion actually is a bit confusing; 	[1]  really liked practice test, wish there was a lot more time for review; [2]  group discussion is beneficial and i'm concerned about the test. material is rushed and there is so much information i don't know what to study. a better review would've helped; [3]  we have gone through a lot of material and i don't know how much detail we need to know for the test. very rushed test review.;
11 	1) Different strengthening mechanism for single phase metals and their application (cold work: 3, solid solution hardening: 1, general: 7) [11];2) Different process of fabrication of metals (I-beams: 3, general: 3) [6];3) Recrystallization & grain boundary  changes[5];4) Misconception: even adding a weaker metal to a stronger metal will make the alloy stronger [2];5) 3-D edge and screw dislocation models [2];6) Cyclotron and uranium info [2];7) The difference between Hot & Cold working a metal & its effects on the crystal structure of a metal [1];8) how to affect materials' strength & ductility [1];9) Dislocations [1] 	1)How does dislocation affect Thermal & Electrical conductivity [8];2) What is Cold Working, % Cw calculation, how to read its graphs,  why ductility reduces by CW, CW vs hot work, CW vs Grain size reduction [8];3) Grain Size Reduction understanding, hall-Petch equation, Anealing relation to dislocation and grain size,  recrystallization, properties of metals after grain growth [7];4) First activity, difference between deformation processing (Rolling, drawing, extrusion, etc) [6];5) Final activity (Effect of CW, Annealing, grain size on Mechanical & other prop.)  [2];6) Why the strengthening occurs based on cold working or hot working [1];7) Why does lead allow for hot working at such a low temp? [1];8) Different strengthen mechanism [1] 	1) Group discussion helps a lot (including: explaining to others, learning from classmates or TAs) [6];2) Activities are very helpful (Including: activities with the graphs, doing it first by myself then within a group) [5];3) Visually [2];4) Graphs and pictures help if: they are explained, they are well labled [2];5) Seeing more applications and real life examples [2];6) HW preview problem and redoing it at the class [2];7) Phoenix to Tucson example helped [1];8) New Concepts;9) Don't like the preview problem of the HW 	[1]  the difference between hot & cold working a metal & its effects on the crystal structure of a metal; [2]  i thought learning about the different applications and  processes of metals was interesting; [3]  i really was interested in how different product (i- beams, bike gears, etc.) are made using different strengthening mechanism; 	[1]  what is cold working and why does it increase ys and ts but not ductility; [2]  which process strengthens materials more effectively? cold working or grain size?; [3]  how the electrical + thermal conductivity increases or decreases based on the dislocation density was a bit unclear; 	[1]  i visualize thing better when the process is described as well; [2]  the dislocation crystal models are very cool and i saw that it helped people understand it better; [3]  i learn by hand on materials and being told things in bullet points about hands on materials.(for example: when you passed around the screw dislocation model you told us "as it goes in a spiral motion around the model, the go down a  level known as the burgers vector");
12 	1) Solubility limits (Saturation graphs, Saturation and Temp. relation, 1 activity, how sturation limit affects other properties of materials) [10];2) Phase diagram (Composition of alloy, how it shifts from 1 phase to 2 phase, the giraffe!) [9];3) Eutectic composition and how the alloy with lowest melting point can be extremly strong [6];4) The reason that cast iron is weaker than steel and their microstructure [3] 	1) Labling phase regions of phase diagram (Activity) [18];2) Interpreting the phase diagram graph [8];3) What Î± & Î² exactly are and what does Î±+Î² mean?

[6];5) Sfirst activity of graph % sugar in solution [2] 	1) Group activities [15];2) Need more explanation on graphs [4];3) Interactive class is good [3] 	[1]  that a metal blend can have the greatest alloy strength & the lowest alloy melting point; [2]  that the eutectic composition has lowest melting pt and highest ts; [3]  adding a metal (pb) with high melting point to metal (sn) with low melting point, it produces an even lower melting point. eutectic pt.; 	[1]  why is the £\+£] regions ( g on phase diagram activity) called the 2-phase region if both component are solid; [2]  labeling 2 phase regions of a phase diagram was very muddy and went by way too quickly, needs more explanation; [3]  activity-labeling 2 phase regions of a phase diagram; 	[1]  i like graphs and diagrams, but when i cannot understand them i become frustrated; [2]  i actively learned the first word of that sentence if you really wanted me to learn about how i learn you'd make me to create my own reflection sheet; [3]  if the homework is just like the activities, then i will know what to do. otherwise i feel like i've learned nothing when i look at the hw;
13 	 	 	 	[1]  i finally understand the graphs. so learning about the different ways to interpret it was interesting; [2]  i was fascinated by the discussion of the phase diagrams and how you calculate the phase fraction; [3]  i found the phase diagrams to be interesting  and easier to understand; 	[1]  copm.as material cools from l to £\+l to £\+£]; [2]  i saw that a lot of people had problems interpreting the diagrams, but i didn't have any problems; [3]  at first 2 had no ? what was going on but once we did on activity, my peers helped me understand the material and i think i know the material how..; 	[1]  i think it helps when i try an activity by myself first, and then go over it with others; [2]  putting a lot of effort into the previous classes homework often means that i already know what is taught in the next class; [3]  i like learning how to interpret the graphs. it's fun and it helps me understand the materials;
14 	 	 	 	[1]  the most important part of the iron-carbon phase diagram only involves between 0 and 15 % carbon; [2]  i thought it was interesting to learn how steel has progressed through the ages; [3]  i thought that the phase diagrams and how they relate to the different microstructures was very interesting; 	[1]  i still don't quite understand how to classify the steel and find it on a graph; [2]  how does cold working and material learned about processing materials effect our knowledge of phase diagrams?; [3]  i'm still a little unclear on how to calculate the fraction of each phase; 	[1]  group activities, doing phases two classes in a row helps memorization; [2]  lectures make more sense when i read the textbook; [3]  i learn best by seeing graphs (diagrams) and then explained to me step by step;
15 	 	 	 	[1]  time/ temperature effects of quenching on strength and ductility; [2]  significance of both time and temp. especially how rapidly it must be quenched to altering structures like lower bainite; [3]  i thought it  was interesting (and easy) to learn about heat treatments; 	[1]  how is martensite used? what applications would need very high strength w/ low ductilities?; [2]  you should really creat a different/ simplified sets of note to give to student. have you seen what some of these pictures look like in black and white? eg. first slide from todays class; [3]  why is it that the line *? passes the finish time? why can't it just stop at finish?; 	[1]  if things/ concepts are related to things i already know about in my own life, i will retain the information better; [2]  i learn when i write stuff down interact with others; [3]  i learn the best when i work with a group on the in class activities;
16 	 	 	 	[1]  new dreamliner is constructed from age hardened al alloy; [2]  i thought that the discovery of age hardening and how it works was very interesting; [3]  wilm's discovery of age hardening an al-cu alloy with mg; 	[1]  do materials continuously age? or is there a point when their ys is constant?; [2]  the mechanism by which age hardening creates barriers to dislocation motion. what exactly is going on when it is age hardened; [3]  how to use two graphs to determine age hardening temperatures and solution treatment temperatures; 	[1]  learn better with more in depth explanations of how/ why sth happens; [2]  the graphs need to be bigger so that i can actually practice using them; [3]  i learn best when we do in-class activities with our table group;
17 	 	 	 	[1]  polymers in general are interesting. the o-chem is exciting; [2]  the hands-on activity (forks, bags, etc.) & learning about things like how candles & plastic bottles are practically the same, besides the molecular weight; [3]  i thought the plastic bag demonstration was cool. the rubber band amazed me on how it warmed up when it was stretched out; 	[1]  relation between transparency + types of polymers- not explained clearlyall the specific molecules/ ? in condensation - don't know them so it really didn't make sense; [2]  i understood today's lesson well, i was very interested in the lesson. probably because i had hand on materials; [3]  i found the actual carbon + hydrogen structure a little confusing; 	[1]  i enjoyed the high no. of pictures relating familiar objects/ materials to atomic structure; [2]  i really liked today's class! i learned that i learn more & am more engaged with hands-on activities :); [3]  you teach us too much. you should spent lots of time teaching us the important stuff and not teach/ talk about unimportant things. if i want to learn something & "wont be held responsible" for, & know where the library is;
18 	 	 	 	[1]  i thought the picture of the processing of polymers were cool. they help categorize polymers; [2]  i thought that it was very interesting that ford motor company actually made a motor out of a polymer, even though it was never brought into production; [3]  the process used to produce polymers was interesting even though it was cut-short; 	[1]  no units on log e vs. t curve graph on first page, and it appears like polymers are more viscous as tem goes up; [2]  how to know where tg is. seems as if description on slide 2 doesn't match where we marked it on the graph as a class; [3]  where certain polymers go on log e vs. t curve; 	[1]  because of picture associations in this class i've used picture associations in another class and it's been very helpful; [2]  i learn best by seeing visual and seeing real life examples of topics we discuss in pictures; [3]  i actually need to spend more time with material on my own to weed-out my own muddy points;
19 	 	 	 	[1]  i find out names of everyday materials and what they do it. it interests me to see how they change and know why the change that way; [2]  log e vs. t curve understand it much better; [3]  relating glass transition and melting temp. to structure and stress/ strain curve; 	[1]  log modulus of elasticity vs. temp. curve, graph hard to read; [2]  i still don't understand how to determine which stress vs. strain curve goes with what material. i don't understand how to use the ductility tm and tg to determine the curve; [3]  i thought that the effect of strain rate on the log e vs. t curves was just a little confusing; 	[1]  we should watch videos in class. even a couple, short youtube videos would help explain materials better; [2]  i like doing the activities, i just wish there was more explanation sometimes to help with understanding; [3]  i learn last when the graphs (log e vs. t) were explained step by step. it helped to visually see the graphs with the explanation.;
20 	 	 	 	[1]  i thought it was interesting learning about differences of conductors, semiconductors and insulators; [2]  it was interesting that properties that affected conductivity of good conductors affected the conductivity properties of semiconductors/ insulators; [3]  using physics and chemistry to calculate electrical properties of materials; 	[1]  how does grain size / grain boundary area affect conductivity in metals or semi-conductors; [2]  does crystal structure affect conductivity? eg. lattice size affects the distance of atoms from each other -> will this change the size of the energy bonds?; [3]  energy state vs. energy band (slide 7-8), what are the "12 states" for the 2s electron band?; 	[1]  we should watch videos in class to clarify the topics; [2]  your analogy of stadium seating is not as effective as the cars in a traffic jam analogy prof. anwar uses.; [3]  learning about topics that relate to the mechanisms and operation of everyday devices (computers) is interesting and makes me want to learn more;
21 	 	 	 	[1]  it was kind of interesting to learn about semiconductors, i already learned this in chemistry though; [2]  today was very interesting especially when i was able to understand what we were talking/ learning about; [3]  i thought that the effects of temperature on n-type and p-type semiconductors was very interesting; 	[1]  don't get the bad gap diagram?how do you find fractional hole vs. electron?; [2]  n-type, p-type? do they have differences between conductivity by mechanism¡K; [3]  why the certain groups are either n-type or p-type; 	[1]  multiple choice questions with more than one correct answer make you think a lot more, and i seem to learn a lot more; [2]  i wish calculations on the homework were done as examples in class because the book does a poor job of giving examples and i don't think it's fair that my grade is lowered because i don't know how to do a calculation; [3]  i learned that i learn best when i get to work as a group on an in-class activity with the people at my table;
22 	 	 	 	[1]  pnp metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor can be programed and will hold charge to retain info¡K; [2]  i found that the semiconductor devices to be very interesting. i understood just about everything; [3]  i found it amazing how there are so many steps and a lot of work that is put into creating transistors (especially the ones in computer chips); 	[1]  how does the pnp/ npn thing work? how can you make the gate positive or negative?; [2]  how does a dipolar junction transistor work & how does it differ from a mosfet?; [3]  i am fine but i saw others in class getting ¡K in the terminology and thus didn't understand the final concept; 	[1]  activities help more than just lecturep.s. lets have enough time for test review on tuesday!; [2]  i understood this last semester when i learned it in chemistry. however now i'm super confused. i don't understand any of it.; [3]  i learned that i learn best when the pictures in the notes are gone over and explained to me as i take notes;
23 	 	 	 	[1]  the different types of glass: soda lime, lead glass, borosilicate and high silica; [2]  glass w/ lead oxide can prevent radiation from passing through; [3]  i thought that the major glass types and their different uses and properties was very interesting; 	[1]  atomic structure of glass ceramics (was not included in preview problem, skipped straight to processing?, explanation in class didn't go into detail about which bonds are ionic/ covalent, do you start w/ sio2 then add an ion like just ca? or add cao?); [2]  i was confused as to why some ceramics don't break easily?; [3]  the effect of composition on high temperature viscosity was pretty confusing; 	[1]  thank you for the review, it helps a lot!; [2]  rushing through review is not as helpful, stressful:* do review before covering new materials or* assign as hw + just go over answers in class (no time spent working on it); [3]  i learn best by seeing pictures that illustrate different concept, makes things easier to understand;
24 	 	 	 	[1]  the plane brake cooling story was an interesting example of ceramics applications; [2]  the fact that ceramics have replaced metals in a variety of industrial applications; [3]  i thought that the advanced ceramics applications for automobile engines and for airplanes was a very interesting discussion; 	[1]  how do you correspond glass type to materials/ object?; [2]  would like more detail on why certain compositions are for certain applications/ processing; [3]  the types of atomic bonding in ceramics could have been review just a little better; 	[1]  i forgot to put on the assessment of learning activities that the reason i didn't like the homework was because the wording on a lot of the questions can be confusing, and useful formula can be hard to find; [2]  i like talking things over in small groups. it lets us help each other and be helped. i also like the mini lectures because they feel more like conversations than lectures; [3]  i like learning about the processing because it helps me remember better;
25 	 	 	 	[1]  at the end of class, thinking about all the things we went over to remember a point of interest probably helped me put more of what i learned in long term memory; [2]  i found the polymers unit fascinating. i plan to take a future upper-division polymers course. overall it was nice to be able to provide feedback on what i liked. without the point of interest response it's hard to give this info to an instructor.; [3]  although i did not reflect as much as i should have, i reflected upon what i did not understand. if i didn't understand something it was always on my mind.; 	[1]  i think i might have been more aware of what i needed to focus on; [2]  going over the muddiest point everyday is great for a student like me because he usually went over things i struggle on and so i knew exactly what to study; [3]  it was hard for me to determine what i didn't understand, i usually left these blank when i didn't have outstanding misunderstandings; 	[1]  they helped me understand in what i learn the best; [2]  the learning point was not something i filled out regularly. it was useful when i did learn something about how i learned . i liked the course and the instructor, so i liked being able to give feedback about learning about how i learned when i did have something to say.; [3]  even when attempting to monitor "how i learn" i learned nothing, because i know a lot about how i learn, and the little i don't i can't learn by sitting in this class and just thinking about the lectures;
