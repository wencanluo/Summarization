True okay so
I give you my wind treasure card and do you also want my helicopter card
Okay to just my wing card and I have one more move and will just move on I don't think is anything else I should do with my last move


Okay okay so I'll I'm sure of the sentence rock

The wind statue went





You can't fight back you can only fly once
Okay you have a helicopter already
And then will fly off. We know we need it for right

Before of us then let's go

It's up to you
I don't know
Using now
As we have that's just let me of most of

Well at least on the bright side we can afford to lose that
We do is it no one's over here boo-boo we can't lose both of these





Right there that's gone
But just in case coffee okay on
What are we I don't know the orders is the water pertinent
Like can you pick two and then choose to do because I would do what is right to take that back

I want sure there's like a thing in the role saying that you know you discard after you
Oh he's a ham limit



Okay
For future reference



And I could give you this you wanted
So we should just say

You gonna say

Because I want to give him my card so he can move then


You could sandbag the copper gate


You could helicopter lift us do that
Call dad do that
Okay

Yeah
And










Fairly













Once per turn any tile on the island for one













30 look through them so do you guys want me to keep on reading

Coordination




As pilot a return I can fly to Anytown the island for one action

Cooperation to do as well as you can try to trust each other

Hey when I was wondering this






























We're gonna have to say. Landing from sinking
One person's gonna have to
Sure up full standing


And



We gonna need him yeah we're gonna need to probably get home and Garden
Or whispering Garden because we have
For wind
Statue's treasure cards
Found

That


I know


I mean we we can decide


Yeah yeah





Okay

Receive


There's two helicopters of cards so
I'll just use the up helicopter left to fight back



Yeah
Yeah yeah












Yeah it for planning is picked then we have to continually
Stay there and bring it up

Yeah

I'm trying to like scratch my nose without touching the Mike



We have to generally protect the treasure tiles released ones we need
Yeah


Keep and keep one helicopter slept for the end

Yeah
Their fire
Okay will hold this is where you would start with you




Yeah

You can short







Call why not just move and then short of the two



Yeah
Okay
And then try to treasure cards


Immediately

To
Which are
Irongate


This


And then dropped



Okay


For now I just focused on trying up stuff









Draw the 2 foot cords


Brookstone



Reactions
On
I think I'm just gonna
Go to hearing sure if that's just just because I don't really don't have many other turn many of the things I could do
Then I think I'm going to
Flyover to hear just because like if I get any cards over here I could
Try to get one of these three churches when you guys handle this stuff like to hear

Fire and helicopter list






Yeah
What you could do it because you can short two at a time just moved here and chart birth







You just choose

Yeah it's on the second page
At the bottom

I'm probably gonna end up getting fired


And


Yeah



Price shuffle
Okay

This one might think
And

Yeah
There




Okay I'll take three actions
I want to fly to you
That's one option I'll give you a card and you
I would just discard

Sure go and then
You want to do something about
This area



Lose one
Oh that's right okay


Otis
I have the option to fix this later


Rock sandbags

Dunkin' Donuts

Yeah your Templeton
And is going as well
Okay




Discard
Yeah


You
You can move here safe to
Or you can move one and then save these to
Wait yeah 12 and a beast

It's you can to talk to one action is your engineer
You can move more than once

Think






Comfort
Forest can we can do
Right but we don't want this to be cut off unless we get that one

Try to use
I guess you can't really but we have to be standing on
Here what if I wasn't I could fly you to us
But then
Yeah

How about at the end of your turn I can fly you to us is in the helicopter left and then we'll just give it to you for returns
And then you can just walk down to the earth


Yeah
Orkester five
I would
Before you try your next two cards you should probably
Whether you want to get rid of sandbag or not
Yeah

Anyone the board
And don't have to use or something

You can because if you trying out yeah a-Gonna you're gonna have to get rid


Yeah actually
I'd say keep this as well
And


Is that the returns for you
Thousand saved on



What is rise for stock


That's





Crimson Forest card






With what

See







Always put so we can get rid of the waters rise card

Five
's

Oh yeah cause that's too
If you just give me the wind
Can start clicking wind and flying around
I


Okay should I I'm gonna have to use one of these cards
After I do my moves

Either send a cover gate for helicopter left us
Under Brock

And then I I'm done with this


Three
Card




Okay so when you say one of these



Give me the wind statue and I'll use him sandbag maybe to say one of the two wind statue places
Cause I'm gonna five cards
Which one
Nothing that can be set engine
So

This was closer.



Wait
On

Either you either go towards Falls Landing or just helicopters left us
Heard two full sending
Yeah okay




Be of options












And



Hundred


And then





In the game here


Either way it doesn't make this one safer

This be a decent from was landing so
So we have to wait until my turn again to win the game unless when you guys pics of helicopter list

We could've used car I want to move to hear that

And then
I will get this
I can three




Save
Yeah
Just save it to







Yeah
Now on the time crunch to get the highest score possible and go fast


Silvergate gone just those two



Are you find me over and then I'll flies out
Myself
